{- Some wording & structure:

    Shader (with a majuscule) = "GPipeShader" => [(OpenGL program made of OpenGL shaders, condition)]

    When a Shader is compiled, it means that it is translated into OpenGl shader
    sources (with a context) which are compiled then linked in programs when
    wrapped into a rendering action which select the appropriate shader at
    runtime.

{-
I'm not a big fan of the ShaderM monad, because its important part is its side
effects. A the end of the day, we always end up with a ShaderM os () and are
only interested in the 'told' drawcalls with the 'put' ShaderState. When a
ShaderM is not returning a () value, there are no drawcall (yet), the returned
value is mostly a work in progress constructed and the context of the ShaderM is
not really used (WriterT is not used in any cases). I'm probably talking outside
my level of profiency here, but I suspect it would have been cleaner & clearer
to separate the WriterT.
